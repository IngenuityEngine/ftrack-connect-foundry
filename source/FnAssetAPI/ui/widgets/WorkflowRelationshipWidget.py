  This widget provides a way for a user to select some kind of relationship

  renders' or 'get me the approved comps'.  It should not ever list individual
  entity references in the UI, this is the domain of the MultiPickerWidget.

  The widget's responsibility is to produce a 'criteria string' that describes
  this relationship. It will later be passed to the getRelatedReferences call
  along with the reference of interest. It's important that this criteria
  string does not directly reference any particular entity.

  Entity References are provided by the host in some cases in order to help
